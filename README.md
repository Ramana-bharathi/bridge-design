# bridge-design
Developed a lightweight bridge design for carrying people on foot and performing a preliminary structural analysis on the same for different load conditions

I personally contributed in analyzing the bending moments and deflections of the lower horizontal bars that stretch across the bridge and in integrating the complete analysis of the bridge design.
